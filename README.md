# Cloud Functions Dash
This is a repo that showcases my personal progress of learning Firebase functions. This is part of my transition to being a Data Scientist. I have been working on this for a few days now and I am excited to see what I can do with it.


## Why this repo was created
Firebase is a great mobile app backend and with its cloud functions feature, extends its capabilities and presents very many opportunities to create rock solid mobile apps.
